# InjectJsLib - inject js code on a currently viewed webpage 

This code is based on Allan Jardine's Visual Event 2 ([webpage](http://sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2), [github](https://github.com/DataTables/VisualEvent)).
It has been stripped to provide just the functionality of loading external libraries (that is js, css and image files).

## Use it

Try the demo on http://krzysztofmadejski.github.io/InjectJsLib

1. In your library implement interface as in  [SomeLib.js.template](https://github.com/KrzysztofMadejski/InjectJsLib/blob/gh-pages/examples/SomeLib.js.template)
2. Modify values in the demo above to point to your library
3. Copy generated bookmarklet link and include it on your site 

## How to get involved

Any idea how this library can be extended? Post an issue.
