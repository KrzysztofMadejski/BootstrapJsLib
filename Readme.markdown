# InjectJsLib - inject js code on a currently viewed webpage 

This code is based on Allan Jardine's Visual Event 2 ([webpage](http://sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2), [github](https://github.com/DataTables/VisualEvent)).
It has been stripped to provide just the functionality of loading external libraries (that is js, css and image files).

## Make it go!

As Visual Event is a bookmarklet, installing and running it on any web-page is extremely simple:

* Open the [Visual Event bookmarklet page](http://sprymedia.co.uk/VisualEvent) and drag the "Visual Event" link to your bookmark bar
* Load a web-page which uses one of the supported Javascript libraries
* Click "Visual Event" in your bookmark bar
* View the event handlers which are attached to the document elements.

A demo of Visual Event that is automatically loaded is [available](http://sprymedia.co.uk/VisualEvent/demo). This demo uses [DataTables](http://datatables.net) to create a test page with a number of events attached to different elements.

## How to get involved

Any idea how this library can be extended? Post an issue, or even better - a pull request.
